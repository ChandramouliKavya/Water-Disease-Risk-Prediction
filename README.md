# 💧 Water and Disease Risk Prediction
This project aims to predict water safety and disease risk levels using machine learning models based on various water quality and environmental indicators. It can help researchers, policymakers, and public health organizations take proactive actions in improving water quality and preventing disease outbreaks.

## Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/water-pollution-and-disease/data

## 🔍 Features Used
**Water Quality**: pH level, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, lead concentration, bacteria count

**Environmental**: rainfall, temperature, population density

**Socioeconomic**: healthcare access index, GDP per capita, sanitation coverage



## 🛠️ Models Built
Prediction Target	Model Type
Disease Risk Level : 	Classification
Water Safety : 	Classification
Cholera Cases (per 100,000 people) : 	Regression
Diarrheal Cases (per 100,000 people) : 	Regression
Infant Mortality Rate :	Regression

## 🌍 Live Deployment : https://huggingface.co/spaces/kavyasri0821/water_and_disease_risk_predictor


## 📊 What the App Does
✅ Takes user input on water quality, environmental, and socioeconomic factors
✅ Predicts:

Water Safety (Safe / Unsafe)

Disease Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

Expected Cholera, Diarrheal Cases, and Infant Mortality Rates

## ✅ Provides actionable recommendations for:

Public health interventions

Environmental management

Policy and planning


## 📈 Future Improvements
✨ Add more real-time water sensor data

✨ Integrate GIS maps for spatial visualization

✨ Include early warning alerts for disease outbreaks
